Linear regression is a fundamental concept in the field of supervised machine learning. It is a statistical technique that allows modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (**target**) and one or more independent variables (**features**) through a linear equation. The goal of linear regression is to find a straight line that best fits the training data to predict the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

In this project, we will analyze a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and use the least squares algorithm trained by **Gradient Descent** to make predictions based on the training data.
